  <h3>Week 5: 3D Design and Printing</h3><br>
</div>


<xmp style="display:none;">

## Assignment

The assignment this week was to 1) make a model for 3D printing, 2) do something with photogrammetry, and 3) update the website with more info for the final project.

## 3D Printing

For 3D printing, I wanted to start with something small to get used to the printers and workflow. My husband and I cook a lottt of Chinese food so eat with chopsticks most nights -- hence, I thought it would be cool to print out a little chopstick holder. Next lunar new year is the year of the snake, so I wanted to make snake shaped ones, but am worried about needing supports, so started out with a simple design I found on Thingiverse.

The stl file for that holder is <a download href="/harvard_ps70/05_3dprinting/pics/chopstick_holder.stl">here</a> and the gcode file is <a download href="/harvard_ps70/05_3dprinting/pics/chopstick_holder.gcode"> here </a>.

Prusa Slicer indicated there may be overhang issues with this design, probably because it doesn't sit flush on the ground, but I'll try it still because other designs all say they'll take much longer.

I had some issues with the 3D printer because I put the SD card in backwards (d'oh) but then got everything working with Bobby's help and printing was underway!

## 3D Printing Take 2

I was pretty disappointed with my first attempt at 3D printing and wanted to make something that would be more useful in preparation for my final project. I have an autoimmune disease so take several medications every day and all of the pill boxes I buy from Walgreens keep breaking on me, so I decided to make a pill box. I don't have the time or desire to learn how to do this in Fusion myself, so found a <a href="https://www.printables.com/model/48132-larger-weekly-pill-box">premade model</a> to go off of online.


## Photogrammetry

I decided to use a phone app for 3D scanning and downloaded the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ai.polycam&hl=en_US&gl=US">Polycam app</a> for my Android phone. The app requires that you take at least 20 images of the object to model then upload the images to get the model. I scanned my sunglasses, which I figured would be a pretty easy item to model.

The results turned out horribly! The model captured the table and background of my hand. I think it would work much better if I had the object on a stand in our little white box in the classroom to remove those anomalies. But it was fun to try out and I'm not planning on using 3D scanning for my final project so am not worried about figuring it out.

## Final Project

I made a final project linnk on my website that includes the details about the final project.
