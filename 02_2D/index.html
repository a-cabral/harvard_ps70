  <h3>Week 2: 2D Cutting and Design</h3><br>
</div>


<xmp style="display:none;">
<br> 

This week's assignment was to use design a box in Fusion 360 and cut it out with the laser cutter. We were also asked to do some 3D modeling in Fusion 360.

## Planning my Box

After seeing some of the examples Nathan showed us in class, I decided that I wanted to do a mix of the jigsaw sort of press fitting walls and some scoring to fold the sides up. I also wanted to put in a door because I imagine that having a door will be useful for environmental sensing enclosures to allow researchers to get in, take out the SD card, etc. 

I sketched out my initial design in my personalized Hello Kitty lifeplanner (yes, it's a real thing). First, I imagined that the entire front panel would be attached using the jigsaw/teeth method, but then I realized I could have it attached to the bottom with a score line.

Having the front attached to the bottom with a score line made it easier to assemble, but did require me to create a separate sketch for the door.

## Box 2D Modeling

I started by just trying to figure it out in Fusion 360 based on what we learned in class. I got pretty far along then used Nathan's video for the teeth and mirroring. I had already made rectangles for the four panels, but Bobby showed me how I could mirror just small parts, which was helpful to mirror just the teeth then. I made my box with 8 teeth and played around by changing the parameters to use less, which left a lot of extra lines but generally worked.

I made two separate sketches, one for the outline of the box and another for the door. I also cut them separately in the laser cutter, which required me taping down the box to score the inside of the front flap for the door.

Initially I planned to engrave a beaver on the door, but after learning how to use the vinyl cutter I decided to instead put a beaver sticker on the door. This was pretty easy by just using Inkscape to import a file then searching for beaver and pasting that in. But Sophia said that it looked like a turtle, maybe because I chose lime green :D.

Because the teeth didn't fit together perfectly, I had to glue the box together, which I did on the inside creases to hide the glue. In retrospect, less teeth may have been useful and I could have added an offset for the angle to fit the teeth better.

Then I found a "doorknob" in the Toy Parts bin, which I glued onto the door. Finally, I went to the white box in the lab to take some glam shots of my box and used it to store some parts I grabbed from the SEC EE Active Learning Lab.

## Fusion Tutorial

I went through some of the CAM CAD tutorials, the main issue I still have is around mirroring. I probably need to practice more but enjoyed learning more about angles and such.

## 3D Modeling

I have an autoimmune disease so take a LOT of medications. One of the former projects that was interesting to me was the smart pill box. But actually, I realized that I don't need a smart pill box, just one that stays together, as the plastic ones I buy at the pharmacy keep breaking.

So I decided to make a 3D model of a pill box. I'll start simple with one small container then scale up to a week long box with one container per day then scale up again to a week long box with multiple containers per day.

I found a good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSBsBTMsGTk">YouTube tutorial</a> about making a 3D hinged box that I used to get a head start. This helped me learn about the Extrude tool, Shell tool, and making hinges. The problem with this tutorial is that it assumes a hinge outside the box and I'd rather just have a sort of flap that is scored and opens, so I'll have to play around with that.
