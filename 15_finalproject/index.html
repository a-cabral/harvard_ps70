## Final Project Idea

I am moving forward with the project to try and make a camera trap for beavers. The basic gist is to have a device that triggers a camera based on motion and then takes a picture.

There are a lot of challenges around this project, including:


### Materials and Timeline

I have to think a bit more about how I want the sensing system to work and maybe chat with Nathan to get his ideas and a better sense of our constraints. I could imagine a few options though for a beaver camera trap. Because the beavers glide along the water, I could have sensors in the water to detect motion and snap photos from there, but this either requires waterproof sensors or a waterproof enclosure that is also transparent. I think this might also need some sort of buoy to keep the hardware at the right position as the river changes height. 

Another option is to try and sense from outside of the water, but this still requires weatherproof enclosures. If everything is outside of the water, I could probably have one enclosure but it still has to be transparent for the camera unless I have a waterproof camera. Or maybe I can make some sort of umbrella to cover the entire device.

For 3D modeling, I think I'll need two enclosures, one to store the Arduino and wires connecting to that and another around the camera and motion sensors, unless I get waterproof camera and motion sensors.

Materials:
* Arduino
* Arducam (I have one already, but there's a waterproof one too that costs $55)
* PIR motion sensor (there is a <a href="https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/waterproof-ultrasonic-sensor-with-separate-probe">weatherproof option</a> for $16)
* Solar panel for power (I have a few small ones in my office that might be enough to power the device, at least for a few days of testing)
* Battery (if this is large enough I maybe don't need the solar panel)

Timeline:
* Week of March 18: Get camera working and saving to SD card
* Week of March 25: Visit Harvard Forest, examine beaver sites, pick a site and use that to determine how the enclosure and hardware setup will work
* Week of April 1: Figure out how to take photos at night, make waterproof enclosures, stand to hold everything, etc.
* Week of April 8: Test everything outside in my yard with rat detection (gross). Fix bugs and anything else necessary
* Week of April 15: Test in Harvard Forest
* Week of April 22: Go through results, determine next steps
