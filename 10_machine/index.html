#### Friday Machine

This week, our assignment was to make a drawing machine as a group. I worked with Sophia Cabral (perhaps my long lost cousin?), Kyra Mo, and Tarun Sasirekha to put together a machine that could draw mandala patterns. Our original goal was to have something that could draw repetitive patterns in sand (like a sand garden), but the actual output was much less exciting.

Kyra's webpage has the documentation for the project <a href="https://k-ra.github.io/PS70/10_machine/week10.html">here</a>. Unfortunatley we had a lot of trouble meeting up to get the different components of the machine all working together. Sophia and I put the machine together, which took much longer than it should have because 1) nearly every lab group was trying to make the same style machine so we had to scrounge for parts that didn't meet the specs of the original design, and 2) the link we followed for the design, based on <a href="https://ctian5136.github.io/ps70portfolio/html/weeks/finalproject.html">Cindy's pen plotter</a> did not have the correct parts so we had to reprint them several times.

Kyra did a great job getting a website set up so that a user could draw a simple line that was then repeated in a mandala style but Tarun did not get the circuit and ESP32 code set up with enough time for us to integrate everything together.

Honestly, this project kind of sucked. Having to spend so much time looking for parts was annoying and I would have rather spent the time working on my final project.
